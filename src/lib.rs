//! **DEPRECATION NOTICE**: This crate has been deprecated. The `type_name`
//! intrinsic has been stablized in
//! [Rust 1.38](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2019/09/26/Rust-1.38.0.html#std:any::type_name).
//! Users of this crate are asked to migrate to [`std::any::type_name`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/any/fn.type_name.html).
//!
//! This crate provides a compatible, safe and stable alternative to Rust's
//! [`std::intrinsics::type_name`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/intrinsics/fn.type_name.html)
//! intrinsic. This is achieved through the [`TypeName`](trait.TypeName.html)
//! trait which is implemented for most types in `std` and can be implemented
//! manually for custom types.
//!
//! This crate also exposes a procedural macro to automatically derive the
//! trait using `#[derive(TypeName)]`. This is an optional dependency which can
//! be disabled by opting out from the `derive` feature in Cargo.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! ```
//! use typename::TypeName;
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     assert_eq!(String::type_name(), "std::string::String");
//!     assert_eq!(Vec::<i32>::type_name(), "std::vec::Vec<i32>");
//!     assert_eq!([0, 1, 2].type_name_of(), "[i32; 3]");
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! You can derive the `TypeName` trait for custom types as follows:
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! #[macro_use] extern crate typename;
//!
//! // Note that Custom<T> will only implement TypeName when T does, too.
//! #[derive(TypeName)]
//! struct Custom<T> {
//!     some_t: T,
//! }
//! ```
//! # Prior work
//!
//! This crate is inspired by the [`named_type`](https://docs.rs/named_type) crate
//! which provides a similar interface. However, its output is not compatible with
//! the `type_name` intrinsic, as its name does not contain the names of the
//! concrete instances of the type parameters.

/// ## Derivable
///
/// This trait can be used with `#[derive(TypeName)]`. The derived impl will require that
/// any generic parameters to the type implement `TypeName` as well.
///
/// ## How can I implement `TypeName`?
///
/// `TypeName` requires that the `fmt` function formats the type name exactly
/// the same way as returned by the
/// [`std::intrinsics::type_name`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/intrinsics/fn.type_name.html)
/// intrinsic. It requires that the name contains the fully qualified path to the type
/// (which can be obtained through the `module_path!()` macro), as well as
/// the concrete values of its generic parameters.
